The fastest way to cache: use the memory!

== Description ==

WP-FFPC ( WordPress Fast Full Page Cache ) is a cache plugin for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress"). It works with any webserver, including apache2, lighttpd, nginx.
It can be configured to join forces with [NGiNX](http://NGiNX.org "NGiNX")'s built-in [memcached plugin](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_memcached_module.html "memcached plugin") for unbeatable speed.

= **IMPORTANT NOTES, PLEASE READ THIS LIST** =

* Requirements:
  * WordPress >= 3.0
  * **at least one** of the following for storage backend:
    * memcached with [PHP Memcached](http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php "Memcached") > 0.1.0
    * memcached with [PHP Memcache](http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcache.php "Memcache") > 2.1.0
    * [APC](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php "APC")
    * [APCu](http://pecl.php.net/package/APCu "APC User Cache")
  * PHP 5.3+ is really highly recommended, see "Known issues"
* This plugin does **not** kick in right after activation. You have to adjust the setting in Settings -> WP-FFPC and save the settings.*


= Known issues =

* errors will not be displayed on the admin section if PHP < 5.3, only in the logs. This is due to the limitations of displaying the errors ( admin_notices is a hook, not a filter ) and due to the lack of proper anonymus functions in older PHP. PHP 5.3 is 5 years old, so it's time to upgrade.
* APC with PHP 5.4 is buggy; the plugin with that setup can even make your site slower. Please use APCu or memcached if you're using PHP >= 5.4

= Features: =

* Wordpress Network support
  * fully supported domain/subdomain based WordPress Networks on per site setup as well
  * will work in Network Enabled mode only for subdirectory based Multisites ( per site settings will not work in this case )
* supports various backends
  * memcached with [PHP Memcached](http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php "Memcached")
  * memcached with [PHP Memcache](http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcache.php "Memcache")
  * [APC](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php "APC")
  * [APCu](http://pecl.php.net/package/APCu "APC User Cache")
  * [Xcache](http://xcache.lighttpd.net/ "Xcache") - not stable yet, volunteer testers required!
* cache exclude options ( home, feeds, archieves, pages, singles; regex based url exclusion )
* (optional) cache for logged-in users
* 404 caching
* canonical redirects caching
* Last Modified HTTP header support ( for 304 responses )
* shortlink HTTP header preservation
* pingback HTTP header preservation
* talkative log for [WP_DEBUG](http://codex.wordpress.org/WP_DEBUG "WP_DEBUG")
* multiple memcached upstream support
* precache ( manually or by timed by wp-cron )
* varying expiration time for posts, taxonomies and home

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents of `wp-ffpc.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Enable WordPress cache by adding `define('WP_CACHE',true);` in wp-config.php
3. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress ( site or Network wide )
4. Check the settings in `Settings` ( site or Network Admin, depending on activation wideness ) -> `WP-FFPC` menu in WordPress.
5. Save the settings. THIS STEP IS MANDATORY: without saving the settings, there will be no activated caching!

= Using the plugin with NGiNX =
If the storage engine is either PHP Memcache or PHP Memcached extension, the created entries can be read and served directly from NGiNX ( if it has memcache or memc extension )
A short configuration example is generated on the plugin settings page, under `NGiNX` tab according to the saved settings.
**NOTE:** Some features ( most of additional HTTP headers for example, like pingback, shortlink, etc. ) will not be available with this solution.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the plugin on Amazon Linux? =
You have to remove the default yum package, named `php-pecl-memcache` and install `Memcached` through PECL.

= How to use the plugin in a WordPress Network =
From version 1.0, the plugin supports subdomain based WordPress Network with possible different per site cache settings. If the plugin is network active, obviously the network wide settings will be used for all of the sites. If it's activated only on some of the sites, the other will not be affected and even the cache storage backend can be different from site to site.

= How logging works in the plugin? =
Log levels by default ( if logging enabled ) includes warning and error level standard PHP messages.
Additional info level log is available when [WP_DEBUG](http://codex.wordpress.org/WP_DEBUG "WP_DEBUG") is enabled.

= How can I contribute? =
In order to make contributions a lot easier, I've moved the plugin development to [GitHub](https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-ffpc "GitHub"), feel free to fork and put shiny, new things in it and get in touch with me [hello@petermolnar.eu](mailto:hello@petermolnar.eu "hello@petermolnar.eu") when you have it ready.

= Where can I turn for support? =
I provide support for the plugin as best as I can, but it comes without guarantee.
Please post feature requests to [WP-FFPC feature request topic](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/feature-requests-14 "WP-FFPC feature request topic") and any questions on the forum.

*2015-10-14*

* adding exclude option based on text entry matching ( regex )

= 1.8.4 =
*2015-10-13*

* changes in HTML debug comment: instead of the former, single comment, now 2 comments are added. The first is added when the cache entry is generated; the second only appears if the page was served from the cached entry. Please note that this last bit will - should - change with every single refresh.
* backend code is now split into separate files
* more debug code

= 1.8.3 =
*2015-05-07*

* small change in key creation: prefix is kept in front of sha1 hashes for debugging purposes

= 1.8.2 =
*2015-04-30*

* sha1 key hashing made to be optional
* added additional debug condition of WP_FFPC__DEBUG_MODE constant to be `true`


= 1.8.1 =
*2015-04-29*

* fixing the wrong release of 1.8.0

= 1.8.0 =
*2015-04-29*

What's new:

* backend keys are now sha1 hashes instead of full url; this is to prevent too long key error with memcached

* logging method changed

= 1.7.9 =
*2015-02-02*

*2014-12-29*

What's fixed:

* wp-ffpc was not actually alerting when it had issues; this should be fixed now

This was a really bad bug and it could have cause a lot of issues since the plugin was probably not working in some cases when the alerts went unnoticed. Due to WordPress restrictions on admin_notices hook I had to use PHP features only present since 5.3. Please keep this in mind.


= 1.7.4 =
*2014-12-17*

What's changed:

* localhost cache forced exclude removed; instead please use `define('WP_CACHE', $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] !== '127.0.0.1');` instead as pointed out by [plescheff](https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-ffpc/commit/eb4942005273822aec8c2da09f0e763807f94f9c#commitcomment-9006031) if required

= 1.6.4 =
*2014-09-12*

What's fixed:

* downgraded log level from halting-level fatal to warning ( thank you PHP for the consistent naming... ) in case the selected extension is missing

* added functionality to include "?" containing URL

What's fixed:

**For Devs**

* the abstract class have been moved into a separate Github repository, [wp-common](https://github.com/petermolnar/wp-common "wp-common"). Because PHP is not capable of replacing/redefining classes, there's a versioning with the abstract and the utilities class, please be aware of this.

= 1.1.1 =
*2013-04-25*

* bugfix: Memcache plugin was diplaying server status incorrectly ( although the plugin was working )
* bugfix: typo prevented log to work correctly

= 0.4.3 =
*2013-03-03*

* long-running %3C bug fixed by the help of Mark Costlow <cheeks@swcp.com>, many thanks for it. It was cause by a bad check in the default values set-up: is_numeric applies for string numbers as well, which was unknown to me, and cause some of the values to be 0 where they should have been something different.

= 0.4.2 =
*2012-12-07*

* added optional sync protocoll option: replace all http->https or https->http depending on request protocol
* binary mode is working correctly with memcached extension
* added warning message for memcache extension in binary mode

**KNOWN ISSUES**

There are major problems with the "memcache" driver, the source is yet unkown. The situation is that there's no response from the memcached server using this driver; please avoid using it!

= 0.4.1 =
*2012-08-16*

* storage key extended with scheme ( http; https; etc. ), the miss caused problems when https request server CSS and JS files via http.

= 0.4 =
*2012-08-06*

* tested against new WordPress versions
* added lines to "memcached" storage to be able to work with NGiNX as well
* added lines to "memcached" to use binary protocol ( tested with PHP Memcached version 2.0.1 )

**KNOWN ISSUES**

* "memcache" extension fails in binary mode; the reason is under investigation

= 0.3.2 =
*2012-02-27*

* apc_cache_info replaced with apc_sma_info, makes plugin faster

* bugfix, duplicated inclusion could emerge, fix added, thanks for Géza Kuti for reporting!

= 0.2 =
*2012-02-19*

* added APC compression option ( requires PHP ZLIB ). Useful is output pages are large. Compression is on lowest level, therefore size/CPU load is more or less optimal.

= 0.1 =
*2012-02-16*

* first public release
